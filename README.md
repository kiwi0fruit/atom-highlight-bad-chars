# Highlight Bad Chars Blacklist

Atom package to highlight bad characters such as No-break space ( ) and en dash (`–`) in your source files.

With this package you'll easily notice invisible and easy-to-confuse characters,
which can be the cause for incredibly annoying syntax errors in source code.

Save yourself the burden of debugging invisible bugs for hours!
